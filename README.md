# T-Block

I think a lot of developers in the beginning of his career were trying to create your Tetris game. And me too. I had a lot of versions, it was written by Pascal language, C#, C++. And I would like to share my last version, it's crossplatform version for mobile platforms: iOS, Android, Blackberry. Due to the violation of the rights I had to remove the versions from the stores
You can found the sources in this repository, and I know, it's shit code, it was a long time ago:) all code is usually shit:)
